## Picking a WoW Addon Name

Your addon will exist among other addons as a subdirectory inside of a players AddOns folder (usually something like `C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns`). Because of this (and a few other reasons detailed further ahead), you will want to try to ensure your addon's name is unique.

Your addon's name should also be free of special characters like `!@#%^&*+` unless there is a specific reason you need such characters in the name.
